### Scripts

  - scRNAseq.R: Main scRNAseq analysis pipeline based on Monocle2.
    Inlcude importing matrix from 10X CellRanger output, QC of cell
    detection, data normalization, dpFeature feature selection, t-SNE
    dimension reduction, density peaks clustering and single cell
    trajectory analysis.

  - magic\_transform.R: Script to do MAGIC imputation on both WT and
    IRF4 KO data sets.

  - scRNAseq\_lib.R: Customized plotting functions based on Monocle2.
    Functions inlcude t-SNE plots with different color schemes, t-SNE
    plots using MAGIC transformed data, SCT plot using different color
    schemas, expression pattern plot over pseudotime.

  - scRNAseq\_replotting: Usage examples of data loading and various
    plotting functions using the above library.

  - KNN\_predict.R: Script to perform KNN prediction based on bulk RNA
    seq data.

  - running\_scenic.R: Scripts to run SCENIC on scRNA data, including
    functions to plot heat maps and perform differential tests between
    score results for various clusters identified in Monocle2.
